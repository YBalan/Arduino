#AutoFeeder: The cat feeder with remote control, scheduling, and feeding history is built upon an Arduino Uno R3 base, incorporating an LCD display (16x2), an RTC DS3231 for real-time clock functionalities, and a Servo MG996R motor. This system allows users to remotely control feeding times, set schedules for automatic feeding, and keeps a log of feeding history for monitoring purposes.
