1.Description:
XY-DJ is a DC 0-60V Battery Charge Discharge Voltage Monitor. It can input voltage fromDC 0-60VBattery with relay switch output which can controller DC0-30V/AC0-250V various equipment. It can set battery discharge voltage to prevent the battery from over-discharging and causing damage. The output switch turn on to the load when the battery charging voltage rises to the allowable discharge value. Therefore, it can effectively protect the service life of the battery and make the use of the battery safer and more reliable. 
2.Features:
	1>.Real-time battery voltage monitoring

	3>.The Upper limit voltage value must be greater than the Lower limit voltage value(UL1 > nL1).
	
	4>.U-1:Charging Measure Mode. 
		4.1>.Relay turn ON to start charging if the Battery Measured Value is less then the Lower limit voltage value nL1. 
		4.2>.Relay turn OFF to stop charging if the Battery Measured Value is more then the Upper limit voltage value UL1. 
	5>.U-2:Charging Measure Time Control Mode. 
		5.1>.This mode needs set charging time OP and its set range is 0~999minute. 
		5.2>.Relay turn ON to start charging if the Battery Measured Value is less then the Lower limit	voltage value nL1. Relay turn OFF and stop charging after the charging time reaches OP. 
		5.3>.Relay turn OFF to stop charging if the Battery Measured Value is more then the Upper limit voltage value UL1. 
	6>.U-3:Discharging Measure Mode. 
		6.1>.Relay turn OFF to stop discharging if the Battery Measured Value is less then the Lower limit voltage value nL1. 
		6.2>.Relay turn ON to start discharging if the Battery Measured Value is more then the Upper limit voltage value UL1. 
	7>.U-4:Charging Measure Time Control Mode.
